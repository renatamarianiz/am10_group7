# Group 7 Final Project

## Background

Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented threat to people’s health status on a global scale. And in our data visualization, we want to focus on the largest country in South America: Brazil, which is the world’s fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous. Until today, a total of almost 6.4 million COVID cases have been confirmed while 5.3 million of them have already recovered. 

## Objectives

We aim to thoroughly understand and visualize Brazil’s COVID cases evolution in multiple dimensions: chronologic, geographic and demographic, to explore different pandemic modes in different regions, ethnicity groups and periods.

## Explored Directions

1. Covid spread within the first months
2. Mortality Rate and Cases per City and State
3. Impact of demographic factors (population / gdp) on mortality rate
4. In-depth analysis of Covids development in Sao Paulo
5. Creation a clustering algorithm
