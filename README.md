# Group 7 Final Project

## Background

Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented threat to people’s health status on a global scale. And in our data visualization, we want to focus on the largest country in South America: Brazil, which is the world’s fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous. Until today, a total of almost 5.9 million COVID cases have been confirmed while 5.3 million of them have already recovered. On the other hand, there’re also cases like Dengue for us to track and make comparisons. 

## Objectives

1.	We aim to thoroughly understand and visualize Brazil’s COVID cases evolution in multiple dimensions: chronologic, geographic and demographic, to explore different pandemic modes in different regions, ethnicity groups and periods.
2.	We also aim to compare COVID evolution in Brazil with other disease as Dengue, etc. What are the different attributes such as infected population, severity and etc. for different diseases?
3.	If we still have time, we also want to compare Brazil with Germany, to analyze pandemic evolution models and reactions in two representative countries in two continents.
